      Now it shall come to pass in the latter days
      That the mountain of the Lord’s house
      Shall be established on the top of the mountains,
      And shall be exalted above the hills;
      And peoples shall flow to it.
      2 Many nations shall come and say,
      “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
      To the house of the God of Jacob;
      He will teach us His ways,
      And we shall walk in His paths.”
      For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
      And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
