      "Now it shall come to pass in the latter days
      That the mountain of the Lord’s house
      Shall be established on the top of the mountains,
      And shall be exalted above the hills;
      And peoples shall flow to it.
      2 Many nations shall come and say,
      “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
      To the house of the God of Jacob;
      He will teach us His ways,
      And we shall walk in His paths.”
      For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
      And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."

          Glad Tidings fellowship (International missions centre) was started in November 1987 in a Tshabalala house. (One of the City of Bulawayo’s suburbs.) God has seen us through all these years and we have grown in Matebeleland and opened  assemblies in the following areas: Nkulumane, Luveve, Kombo, Gwanda (Collen Bawn and Silikwe) Lower Gweru (Bembe, Shagari and Makhulambili) Inyathi and Nyamandlovu (Magwadini).

              <p> We believe in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ, who is the eternal word, co-existing with the Father from eternity. He is the second Person of the God-Head… the very express image of his Person. He was born of a Virgin, sinless, and by his blood redemption has been secured for all humanity</p>

              <p> We believe in the Holy Spirit of God, eternally existing with the Father and the Son, and being the third Person of the God-Head. He is the one who convicts and leads us to Jesus. He is the sole revelatory of all the mysteries of God.</p>

              <p>We believe in the Church, being the Body of Christ here on earth, both Universal and Local. The church is made of all the called out ones, those born of the Spirit of God and adopted as sons of God. The church must assembly for fellowship, instruction from the word of God, teaching, training and equipping for work of ministry. It must participate in Sacraments as instructed by the Scriptures.</p>
